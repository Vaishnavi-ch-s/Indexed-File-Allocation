# ðŸ“‚ Indexed File Allocation Simulator (Java Swing GUI)
This is a **Java Swing-based GUI application** that simulates **Indexed File Allocation**, a memory management method used in Operating Systems. The simulation visually allocates memory blocks for files and displays block metadata interactively.
---
## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Accepts user input for:
  - File name
  - Number of data blocks required
- Automatically allocates:
  - 1 index block (ðŸ”µ blue)
  - N data blocks (ðŸŸ¢ green)
- Validations:
  - Duplicate file name check
  - Checks for sufficient free blocks
-  Interactive GUI:
  - Displays 100 memory blocks in a 10x10 grid
  - Click on an index block to **view its file details** (index & data blocks)
- Color Palette:
  - White = Free block
  - Blue = Index block
  - Green = Data block
