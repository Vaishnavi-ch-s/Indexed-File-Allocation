# 📂 Indexed File Allocation Simulator (Java Swing GUI)
This is a **Java Swing-based GUI application** that simulates **Indexed File Allocation**, a memory management method used in Operating Systems. The simulation visually allocates memory blocks for files and displays block metadata interactively.

## 📌 Features
- 📁 Accepts user input for:
  - File name
  - Number of data blocks required
- 📦 Automatically allocates:
  - 1 index block (🔵 blue)
  - N data blocks (🟢 green)
- 🧠 Validations:
  - Duplicate file name check
  - Checks for sufficient free blocks
- 🖱️ Interactive GUI:
  - Displays 100 memory blocks in a 10x10 grid
  - Click on an index block to **view its file details** (index & data blocks)
- 🎨 Color legend:
  - White = Free block
  - Blue = Index block
  - Green = Data block
